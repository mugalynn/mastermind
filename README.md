# mastermind
 
 This game works on the command line and takes user guesses and gives them feedback.
 
 Things to improve:
 
 - for testing purposes, I currently reveal the secret code at the beginning. It would be more playable without that.
 - I need to write the code for the computer to make guesses so that the two can take turns.
 - I might rewrite it to make it graphical using Gosu (like tic-tac-toe), but I'm not sure I like Mastermind enough to develop it that far.
